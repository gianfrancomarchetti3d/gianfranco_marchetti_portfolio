  <h1>Gianfranco Marchetti</h1>
  <h2>Professional 3D Artist | Calcinate (BG), Italy</h2>

  <p>I specialize in architectural visualization, interior and exterior rendering, and product visualization — crafting compelling and immersive 3D experiences.</p>
  <p>Over the years, I have collaborated with international clients and video game teams, producing detailed 3D environments, assets, and cinematic compositions optimized for games, animation, marketing, and architectural presentations.</p>
  <p>My work focuses on photorealistic rendering, PBR materials, realistic lighting, and seamless integration of CGI with real-world photography. I aim to create visuals that are both technically precise and emotionally engaging.</p>
  <p>I provide full consulting services for visual communication and design projects, guaranteeing high-quality results, punctuality, and meticulous attention to detail in every stage of production.</p>
